    <h1>Merry Christmas love!</h1>
    <p>I've been learning how to code these past few weeks<br> and I figured I'd create
    you a poem through this.<br> please bare with me, this is not a formal formed poem. I love you.<br> </p>
    <h2>trust me when I say</h2>
    <p>trust me when I say that you are my comfort<br> through the days and night when sleeping gets hard,<br> you're the only wonderful thought<br> even when my mind gets cluttered<br></p>
    <p>every love poem, every  love song<br> my mind instantly carves out your face<br> it's as if you're the only person<br> God knows I can't erase<br></p>
    <p>I know when it's love<br> when peace is all we know<br> stumbling upon many challenges<br> slowly but surely we'd both grow<br></p>
    <p>I know that it's real<br> you handle with understanding<br> when I show versions of myself<br> that I plan to conceal</p>
    <p>for you have touched my heart<br> in ways like reading when it rains<br> like being under the stars<br> or noticing the surrounding beauty we can't seem to explain</p>
    <p>good things, that you are<br> good things, you willl be<br> sometime in the future<br> you'll ask me "coffee or tea?"</p>
    <p>I wouldn't notice<br> due to the sight of the sea<br> then you'd ask me the second time<br> I'd say tea cause I don't drink coffee</p>
    <p>but I'd like to try<br>try all of your interests<br> and make up for lost times<br> the times we have missed</p>
    <p>I love you to the point of invention<br> though I'm not smart enough to invent<br> my capacity isn't much<br> as well as my mind torments</p>
    <p>but you bring out the creativity<br> the one that is deep within<br> it's about time I make a poem of my own<br> so through this I'll say<br> I love you to the point of creation</p>
    <p>I formally don't know how this poem will end<br> but do trust me when I say I want to stay<br> because that is what I'll always intend</p>
